I took up surfing a few years ago.

I had these ridiculous dreams of hitting the water, putting in a few sessions, and then quickly finding myself in the perfect Instagram moment on a big wave. If you know anything about surfing, you’ve already started rolling your eyes.

I’ve ingested my weight in seawater more times than I’ll admit. Every time I go out, it becomes more and more apparent how much more time I have to put in. When the water is just right, a small hoard of tightly wrapped men and women will charge, wading through the shallows, to see who can catch the biggest break. Far closer to the beach, I’m just floating, tethered to my board, sometimes even standing on the floor, in the shallow breaks.

In the beginning, it was just a chore, in service of something bigger and better. But, I’ve found a love for this place: the space between the arrival we’re all after and the place where we made the leap to try.

I’m interested in the moments you run right past. What might we miss, in hopes of something bigger and more dramatic? It’s the overlooked: the twice widowed woman in her seventies with leather skin, the 12-year-old boy with the whole world ahead of him, and the dog totally unaware of how short his legs actually are. The water is a sanctuary and I feel a kind of connection with each and every one of them.

What could it mean to build on the notion that things are more meaningful when they’re connecting us to something?

Shallow Breaks is about the people working hard to connect us to each other, to the earth, and to ourselves.

I hope you’ll enjoy diving into their worlds as much as I have.
